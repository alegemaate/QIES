# QIES
Ticket purchasing and management program for CISC327 

QIES (Queen’s Intercity Excursion System)
CISC / CMPE 327 Fall 2018 (Revision 2018.10.01 [002])

## Project Requirements
The product you are to design and build is the Queen's Intercity Excursion System
(“QIES”). It consists of two parts:
- the Front End, an interface for transactions involving transport tickets
- the Back Office, an overnight batch processor that updates a central manifest file

Both parts will be run as console applications, that is, they are to be invoked from a
command line and use text and text file input/output only (this is essential for assignments
later in the project, so don’t ask for exceptions). Avoiding more complex user interfaces in
this course allows us to concentrate on other aspects of software quality.

## Building and Running
- View BackOffice/BackOffice.java for building and running back office
- View FrontEnd/FrontEnd.java for building and running front end
